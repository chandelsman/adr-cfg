# ADR Reporting for CFG
Adenoma Detection Rate Reports provided for Centers for Gastroenterology. Reporting is performed quarterly for CFG Harmony providers. Both ADR and SSADR are calculated using the 2018 CMS guidelines. We receive a files containing all colonoscopies performed from the client because we can only identify colonoscopies when tissue was sent to us. All cases with diagnosis codes Z12.11 or Z80.0 are included. We export data from the 'CFG ADR' dynamic report in LigoLab and use text searches in the diagnosis to identify tubular, tubulovillous, sessile, and malignant results.

*note that all screening colonoscopies are used and the analysis is not restricted to first time colonoscopies
